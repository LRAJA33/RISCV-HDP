## ASSIGNMENT

1. Verify all the c code (counter, matrix multiplication, ALU code using RISC-V compiler and spike output.
2. Measure CPU performance of all the programs mentioned above using either godbolt or RISC-V disassembler.

## NOTES
# CPU Performance Metrics
Computer A is 1.2 times as fast as Computer B (30/25=1.25)

# CPU Execution Time:
The taken by the CPU to take the data from memory, process it and again send back to the memory

# Types of CPU Execution:
Two types of CPU Execution time a) User CPU time (Time spent on User Program) b) System CPU time (Time spent in OS on behalf of User program

# CPU Performance:
CPU Perfromance is calcualted based on the Time spent on User Program
