# About Compiler Explorer
    1. Compiler Explorer, also known as godbolt.org, is an online tool for analyzing assembly output generated by 
     compilers.
    2. It allows developers to explore how high-level code translates into low-level assembly instructions.
    3. Useful for understanding compiler behavior, optimizing code, and comparing compiler output.
