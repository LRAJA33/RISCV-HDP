# RISC-V Product Design

## Overview:

The "RISC-V Hardware Design Program" or "Product Based RISC-V Skilling Program" is a six-week workshop course for people interested in both hardware and software. It's taught by the VSD Team.

## Summary:

This program helps you learn to make software that works on RISC-V hardware. You'll learn to:

Make software that works on real hardware.

Make sure your software and hardware work well together.

Change your software plan into a step-by-step guide.

Write programs in C or other languages for special devices.

Check if your C code works well with different computer systems.

Test your software on a RISC-V computer before making it real.

Describe special parts of a computer.

Change your C code into a language called Verilog, used for testing computer parts.

Make a plan for how to test your computer parts.

## Workshop Agenda for Six Weeks:

## Week 0:

  Set up your computer to work on a special lab.
  
  Make a GitHub account to share your work with others.
  
## Week 1:

Learn about a tool called Godbolt for checking your code.

1. Try out simple arithmetic operation uding Godbolt.
2. Make a simple 4-digit counter using Godbolt.
3. Try out making a matrix multiplication using Godbolt.
